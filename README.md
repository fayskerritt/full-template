# First Website using GitPod
This website will outline the technologies and coding languages that I will be learning during the Full Stack Developer course.

Guidance was taken from the Code Institute course to complete this webpage.

Here is a link to the deployed website - **__https://fayskerritt.github.io/full-template/__**

## Main Functions:
- 3 pages
- Navigation bar on each page
- Header the same across all pages
- Images of each language/technology
- Link to Wikipedia site for each language/technology

I look forward to learning more about these technologies and creating more websites in the future.
